# BoilerDrop TODOs

- [ ] Helper script to download latest BackdropCMS code, with proper file
  permissions, settings.local.php file, etc. (with `drush dl-backdrop` ?)

- [ ] Use `drush backdrop-config-export` and `drush backdrop-config-import`
  functions ?

- [ ] Code check helpers (PHPCS and other CSS/JS linters)

- [ ] Create private files directory, outside of webroot, with proper permissions.
